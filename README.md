# Leetcode practice repo

It's my own log of Leetcode submission.

- main language: `C`,`Java`,`JavaScript`
- extras: `C++`,`TypeScript`,`Go`

## Why JavaScript?

- I do like JavaScript.
- Though JavaScript is not all for me, it's easy to debug as a scripting language.
- Copiled langeuage is hard to debug on Leetcode environment.
