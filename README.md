# Leetcode practice repo
It's my own log of Leetcode submission. 
- main language: `C`,`Java`,`JavaScript`
- extras: `C++`,`TypeScript`

I'm trying to sort everything out with non-library data structure, which means impelment data structure in every languages' *standard library*

(Not applied to some Java solution, they are stock and I'll redo them someday)
