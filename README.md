# Leetcode practice repo

It's my own log of Leetcode submission.

- main language: `C`,`Go`,`JavaScript`
- extras: `C++`,`TypeScript`,`Java`

## Why JavaScript?

- I do like JavaScript.
- Though JavaScript is not all for me, it's easy to debug as a scripting language.
- Copiled languages (except Go) is hard to debug in Leetcode context.
